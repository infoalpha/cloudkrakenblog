Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides on-demand computing resources and services in the cloud, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Advantages:**

* Lower Cost. Pay as you go and usage.
* Don’t have to maintain datacenters(infra).
* Stop guessing Infra capacity. Auto scaling will help us here
* Go global in minutes


**How Do I Access AWS?**

AWS provides 5 ways to create and manage resources.


*	**AWS Management Console:** Web Interface to access AWS Services.
*	**AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):** Commands for a broad set of AWS products.
*	**Command Line Tools:** Commands for individual AWS products.
*	**AWS Software Development Kits (SDK):** APIs that are specific to your programming language or platform. For more information, see SDKs.
*	**Query APIs:** Low-level APIs that you access using HTTP requests. For more information, see the API documentation for each service.

**What is Region?**

* An Amazon AWS region is a physical location or geographic location where we host your data/application. 
* In each region, there will be at least two availability zones for fault tolerance.
* Each region is completely independent.
* Resources aren't replicated across regions unless you do so specifically.
* Note that prices for AWS usage vary by region.
* There 14 Regions Currently Amazon supports.
* Each region contains multiple distinct locations called Availability Zones.
* Amazon don’t replicate resources across regions automatically.


**What is Availability Zone (AZ)?**

* Availability Zone is a combination of one or more datacenters in each region.
* AZ is engineered to be isolated from failures from another AZ’s.
* AWS resources can be tied to a region or tied to an Availability Zone.
* Not every region or Availability Zone supports every AWS resource.
* When you view your resources, you'll only see the resources tied to the region you've specified.
* This is because regions are isolated from each other, and we don't replicate resources across regions automatically.
* An AZ is a combination of one or more data centers in a region.
* These datacenters need not to be separated by multiple kilometers physically but by meters with in a physical compound which are completely isolated from each other failure such as power, network in a AZ.
* It is a logical grouping of data centers, in a region for service high availability.
* These AZs in a region are connected using direct Fiber optic links which have capacity of around 25Tbps bandwidth and a latency of 2ms to 1ms.
* Below list shows availability zones in given regions.
* Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links
